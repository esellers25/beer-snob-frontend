      <p>Let’s face it: not all beers are created equal. A mass distributed brand 
          name doesn’t put in the same care into their batches as your local craft 
          brewery does. You know what you like, and there’s no shame in that.  
          </p>{"\n"}<p>Beer Snob is a resource for you to find that new beer to fall in love with, 
          as well as share your knowledge with other beer enthusiasts.
          We’ve curated a list of some of our favorite craft beers for you to explore 
          and review. And if by chance we’ve missed one of your go-tos, add it to our 
          collection and help spread the word!
          </p>{"\n"}<p>Thanks for being a Beer Snob!
